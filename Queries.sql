-- LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
-- Returns all rows from the left table, plus matched rows from the right table. Unmatched rows get NULL.
--  Use case: Show all employees, even those not assigned to a department.
   SELECT e.Emp_Name, d.Dept_Name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.Dept_id = d.Dept_id;

-- RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
-- Returns all rows from the right table, plus matched rows from the left table
--Use case: List all departments, including those with no employees.
SELECT e.Emp_Name, d.Dept_Name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.Dept_id = d.Dept_id;

--FULL OUTER JOIN (Not supported in MySQL)
--Returns all records when there is a match in one of the tables.
--Use case: List all employees and all departments, showing NULLs where thereâ€™s no match.
-- MySQL workaround using UNION:
SELECT e.Emp_Name, d.Dept_Name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.Dept_id = d.Dept_id

UNION

SELECT e.Emp_Name, d.Dept_Name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.Dept_id = d.Dept_id;

--SELF JOIN
--A table joined with itself.
--Use case: Show employees and their managers using a Manager_id foreign key.
SELECT e1.Emp_Name AS Employee, e2.Emp_Name AS Manager
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.Manager_id = e2.Emp_id;


--CROSS JOIN
--Returns Cartesian product (every row in A joins with every row in B).
-- Use case: Generate all possible employee-department pairings (e.g., for simulation/testing).
SELECT e.Emp_Name, d.Dept_Name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN departments d;
